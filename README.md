# Predictions models for a Store Expansion Project

## Task 1: Determine Store Formats for Existing Stores

A grocery store company is planning to open 10 new stores at the beginning of the year. Currently, all stores use the same store format for selling their products. Up until now, the company has treated all stores similarly, shipping the same amount of product to each store. This is beginning to cause problems as stores are suffering from product surpluses in some product categories and shortages in others.  

We want to provide analytical support to make decisions about store formats and inventory planning.

## Task 2: Formats for New Stores  

The company wants to determine which store format each of the new stores should have. However, we don’t have sales data for these new stores yet, so we’ll have to determine the format using each of the new store’s demographic data. 

We developed a model that predicts which segment a store falls into based on the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the population that resides in the area around each new store. 

## Task 3: Predicting Produce Sales 

Finally, we built an predictive model to have an accurate monthly sales forecast of fresh produce.
